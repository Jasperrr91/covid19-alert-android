    <string name="onboarding_text_1">This app warns about possible infection with Covid-19. We inform you when you have been near an infected person and provide you with important and useful information about the pandemic. This way you can help to delay the further spread of Covid-19. </string>

    <string name="onboarding_text_2">The Covid 19 Alert! app works with bluetooth data.

However, privacy is guaranteed: the use of the app is completely anonymous and it’s impossible to trace back either you or your phone.
